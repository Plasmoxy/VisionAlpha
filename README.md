# VisionAlpha
_Interactive OpenCV webcam color picker program._

It's basically my first JavaFX app.
You can detect colors with your webcam and get hexadecimal color codes out of it.
Made with a wonderful material design library called [JFoenix](http://www.jfoenix.com/).

## IMPORTANT
- you NEED to have **OpenCV JAR and DLL** to run this
- ( link it to project if you are working with sources )
  - you can get it by getting [OpenCV package for windows](https://opencv.org/releases.html)
- libraries needed except OpenCV are in the lib folder

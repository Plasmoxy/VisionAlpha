# VisionAlpha
_Interactive OpenCV webcam color picker program._

It's basically my first JavaFX app.
You can detect colors with your webcam and get hexadecimal color codes out of it.
Made in a wonderful material design library called [JFoenix](http://www.jfoenix.com/).

## IMPORTANT
- you NEED to add a opencv_java330.dll file right next to jar ( or 331 if you want but you have to change it in App.main method )
- ( or link it to project if you are working with sources )
  - you can get it by getting [OpenCV package for windows](https://opencv.org/releases.html) -> Opencv 3.3.0
- libraries needed are in the lib folder
